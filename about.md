## :keyboard: Developer since 1995

My passion with programming began as a child. I was always very curious about computers, to the point of reading the MS-DOS manual to learn more advanced topics using my family's old 386 PC.

:computer: 1995: Introduced to programming in school with BASIC at 13 years old/7th grade.

:globe_with_meridians: 1999: Picked up ASP/VBScript programming and Windows 2000/IIS administration to expand into server-side web applications. Wrote a simple blogging platform.

:mortar_board: 2001: Started my first tech job while a high school senior as a systems administrator and BASIC (BBx) developer writing custom features for an accounting platform.

:briefcase: 2005: Moved to Rackspace, and continued Microsoft server administration, enterprise customer engineering, and infrastructure engineering. Programmed in VB.NET, C#, and Python. Built support automation tools saving tens of thousands of hours manual effort by staff.

:rocket: 2017: Moved to Amazon Web Services as a Sr. Technical Account Manager. My previous Microsoft focus shifted hard toward Linux. I primarily programming in Python to automate repetitive tasks, and to help customers automate heavy lifts using the AWS APIs.

:boom: 2023: Begin learning TypeScript and Node.js. Began work on [discord-bot-ol-bootsie](https://github.com/jlyons210/discord-bot-ol-bootsie), a Discord chatbot that uses OpenAI language models via API. Despite the tedious project setup, this is my preferred language and environment today.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 2025: Continuing to hone my TypeScript skills and expanding my experience across the JS/TS ecosystem.

## :wrench: Engineer since 2001

Though my passion lies in programming, most of my career has followed an engineering path. I have found ways to utilize my programming skills throughout, and find it easy to move between languages because I have worked with many and have strong fundamentals.

I've been a part of the industry from the time it was common for a business to run a small number of in-house servers, to managed hosting, virtualization, and cloud. I'm a big cloud proponent, and can argue that if it's too expensive, you're probably doing it wrong. I can easily find ways to cost-optimize complex workloads. I haven't forgotten how to rack and stack heavy metal, either.

It has been amazing to watch the level of abstractions increase to enable incredible deployment speeds. It used to take 1-2 months to procure and provision bare metal servers. There are so many cloud services available now that cut that down to seconds.

I can (and have) moved from an idea to a deployed website in about an hour, including the time it took to write the webpage.

My current focus is catching up with the Kubernetes world, gaining a deeper understanding of CI/CD pipelines, and intending to pivot into SRE or Platform Engineering work. I crave hands-on technical projects, and keep myself very busy in my homelab.

## üèãÔ∏è Body hacker since 2020

My interest in weightlifting came later in life. My interest is keeping my body performant as I grow older, and I really love the challenge of setting new PRs.

:chart_with_downwards_trend: 2020: I began training with [StrongLifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/). Starting at the bottom as a novice lifter caused me a lot of impatience, and I slapped more weight on "because I could." My form sucked, my consistency was terrible, and my chart showed it. I gave up after about 10 weeks due to a painful life event at the time.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 2023: I decided to get back into StrongLifts, and to do it right. I lasted much longer this time around. I slipped off again after about four months because I had a hard time fitting my workouts into my schedule.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 2024: After an inter-state relocation, I got my gym set up again. I've been lifting again since October 2024, and plan to persist as it's core to my mental health maintenance.
