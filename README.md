# Jeremy likes to code :keyboard:

My journey in tech began as a 13 year old learning to program BASIC in school. I entered the field professionally as a high school senior, and haven't looked back. I've been a systems administrator, infrastructure engineer, customer engineer, and cloud TAM. These roles involved much formal software development, but all have allowed me to code and make others' lives easier. You can learn more about me [here](about.md).

I'm comfortable in multiple languages I've learned over the past 30 years, and mostly active today in TypeScript and Python. I've worked with BASIC, ASP/VBScript, VB.NET, C#, Python, and TypeScript/JavaScript.

I'm pursuing an eventual pivot into SRE or Platform Engineering, and have been developing my skills in Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Action, ArgoCD), and will be expanding my language proficiency to include Golang and Rust :crab:.

I enjoy building Node.js applications that utilize LLMs, including my Discord chatbots:
